I'm a May 2026 graduate from IIT Roorkee with a passion for designing robots, currently working as a **Robotics Engineer (Mechanical)** at [Cenizas Labs](https://cenizaslabs.com), Chennai.

My research focuses on **legged robotics**, **actuator design**, and **mechanical optimization** for robotic systems. I've worked on developing novel planetary actuator configurations, energy-efficient quadruped mechanisms, and soft origami-based robots for real-world applications.

## Research Interests

- **Actuator Design**: Quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuators, planetary gearboxes, and compact high-torque density systems
- **Legged Robotics**: Quadruped locomotion, energy-efficient gait optimization, and novel leg architectures  
- **Co-Design Optimization**: Simultaneous optimization of mechanical design and control for improved robot performance
- **Soft Robotics**: Origami-inspired compliant mechanisms for adaptive behaviors

## Current Work

At **Cenizas Labs**, I'm designing workspace-assistive robots including:
- A differential-drive office bot with multiple actuated shelves
- An 8-DOF carbon fiber robotic arm with 3D-printed cycloidal drives (800mm reach, 1.8kg payload)

I'm also collaborating with research groups at:
- **Indian Institute of Science** (Prof. Shishir Kolathaya) - Optimal gearbox design for QDD actuators
- **University of Notre Dame** (Prof. Mark Plecnik) - Asymmetric 5-bar quadruped mechanisms
- **EPFL** (Remote) - Soft origami-based pipe inspection robots

## Education

**BTech in Engineering Physics** (CGPA: 7.8/10, Department Rank: 9/76)  
Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee | 2022 – 2026

**Relevant Coursework**: Introduction to Robotics, Kinematics of Mechanisms, Optimization Techniques, Numerical Analysis, Data Structures & Algorithms, Signals & Systems
