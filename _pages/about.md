I am a senior undergraduate at **IIT Roorkee**, with research affiliations at the **Stochastic Robotics Lab, IISc**, **CREATE Lab, EPFL**, **Plecnik Group, University of Notre Dame** and **Cenizas Labs**, working at the intersection of **mechanical design, actuation, and legged robotics**. I am deeply interested in building **mechanically intelligent robotic systems**—robots whose performance emerges as much from their embodiment as from control.

I love **designing, fabricating, and experimentally validating novel mechanical systems**, particularly for **quadruped and humanoid robots**. My work centers on actuator design and optimization, where I explore how transmission architecture, stiffness, backlash, and mass distribution influence real-world robot performance. I am especially motivated by designs that simplify control through thoughtful and simple mechanical design.

My primary research interests include:
- Mechanical design of **quadruped and humanoid robots**
- **Actuator optimization and design** for legged systems
- Simulation-driven testing of novel mechanisms
- **Compliant, bio-inspired, and origami-based robots**
- **Space robotics** and robots for extreme environments
