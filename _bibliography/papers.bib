  abstract={We propose a novel configuration for Wolfrom and compound planetary actuators that reduces the mass and axial width of the second stage by nearly 50% while maintaining the same load capacity and efficiency. The design has been validated through steady-state torque analysis and kinematic modeling, and is currently being fabricated for experimental characterization.},
