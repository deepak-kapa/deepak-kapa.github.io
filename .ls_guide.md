## 🎯 Quick Reference

**To add/edit content:**
1. Edit files in `_projects/`, `_news/`, `_pages/`, `assets/img/`
2. Run `./deploy.sh`
3. Done!

**Folders starting with `_` are source folders - EDIT THESE**
**Folders WITHOUT `_` are built folders - IGNORE THESE**

The `_` folders MUST be in root for Jekyll to work. This is standard Jekyll structure.
