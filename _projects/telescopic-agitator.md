## Product Design Challenge
**Solinas - Inter IIT Tech Meet 12.0** | Dec 2023

**🥇 Gold Medal Winner** - Mechanical Product Design Challenge

Designed a portable telescopic agitator capable of extending from **1 m to 5 m** for mixing solid waste with water to generate pumpable slurry.

## Design Innovation

### Telescopic Mechanism
- **Lead-screw driven** telescopic extension system
- Actuated via **cycloidal drive** for high torque and compact packaging
- Smooth extension/retraction for operational flexibility

### Clutching Mechanism
- **Symmetrically distributed clutching system** with radially expanding arms
- Powered by a **single high-torque motor**
- Enables **automatic centering** inside the tank
- Ensures stable operation during mixing

## Key Features

- **Extension Range**: 1 meter to 5 meters
- **Portable Design**: Easy transport and setup
- **High Torque**: Cycloidal drive enables efficient waste mixing
- **Auto-Centering**: Intelligent clutching mechanism
- **Industrial Grade**: Designed for harsh environments

## Applications
