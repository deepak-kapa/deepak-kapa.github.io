## Research Internship
**University of Notre Dame** | Feb 2025 – Present (Remote)

Designed and simulated an **asymmetric 5-bar quadruped mechanism** aimed at improving power efficiency during locomotion.

## Design Innovation

### Novel Leg Architecture
- Developed detailed **CAD model of an 8-DOF quadruped**
- Asymmetric 5-bar linkage for improved efficiency
- Direct-drive configuration for reduced backlash

### Simulation and Analysis
- Performed **dynamic gait simulations in MuJoCo**
- Position control implementation
- Evaluated motor **power consumption** and **total cost of transport**
- Compared against traditional 2R configurations

## Current Work

Working on developing **RL controller** for a 7-bar mechanism quadruped featuring **mode switching** in **Isaac Sim**.

## Key Findings

- Improved energy efficiency over conventional designs
- Better torque distribution across joints
- Enhanced gait stability

## Technical Approach

- **CAD Modeling**: Complete mechanical design in SolidWorks
- **Simulation**: MuJoCo for dynamics, Isaac Sim for RL
- **Control**: Position control and reinforcement learning
- **Optimization**: Comparison with baseline 2R architecture

## Future Work

- Hardware prototype development
- Real-world testing and validation
- Integration of learned controllers
- Mode-switching locomotion strategies
