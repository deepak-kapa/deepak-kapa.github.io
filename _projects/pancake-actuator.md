## Bachelor Thesis Project
**IIT Roorkee & IISc** | Aug 2025 – Present

A novel planetary actuator configuration that achieves significant mass and size reduction while maintaining performance.

## Key Innovation

Proposed a **novel configuration for Wolfrom and compound planetary actuators** to reduce the **mass and axial width** of the second stage by nearly **50%** with the same load capacity and efficiency.

## Technical Approach

- **Design Validation**: Steady-state torque analysis and kinematic modeling
- **Patent Application**: Currently working on patenting the design
- **Experimental Work**: Engaged in fabrication and experimental characterization of optimized actuator prototypes

## Impact

This design enables more compact and lightweight actuators for:
- Legged robots
- Robotic manipulators  
- High-torque density applications where size and weight are critical

## Status

- ✅ Design validated through analysis
- ✅ Patent application in progress
- 🔄 Prototype fabrication ongoing
- 📊 Experimental characterization planned
