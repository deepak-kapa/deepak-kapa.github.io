## Research Internship
**École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)** | March 2025 – Aug 2025 (Remote)

Designed and modeled a **soft origami-based pipe inspection robot** for autonomous maintenance of underground ducts.

## Design Innovation

### Modular CAD Design
- **Compliant arms** actuated by three Kresling tubes
- Enclosed within a **Yoshimura origami shell**
- All driven by a **single-motor planetary gear system**
- Enables navigation in **150 mm diameter pipelines**

### Embodied Intelligence
- Leveraged **embodied intelligence** principles
- Achieves **passive obstacle adaptation** without complex sensing
- Navigation without extensive control algorithms
- Inherent compliance for safe interaction with pipe walls

## Technical Features

- **Soft robotics** approach for gentle contact
- **Energy-efficient** single-motor actuation
- **Compact design** for confined spaces
- **Origami-inspired** deployable mechanism

## CAD and Modeling

Complete 3D model available: [Onshape Link](#)

## Applications

- Underground pipe inspection
- Sewer maintenance
- Industrial duct monitoring
- Infrastructure health assessment
