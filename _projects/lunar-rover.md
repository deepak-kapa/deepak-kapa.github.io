## International Rover Design Challenge
**Team Robocon, IIT Roorkee** | Nov 2024 – Dec 2024

Designed a comprehensive CAD model of a lunar rover to investigate the **Shiv Shakti Point** on the Moon, accompanied by a tri-leg hopping daughter rover.

## Key Features

### Soil Collection System
- **Zip chain actuator** for soil collection at depths of up to **10 feet**
- Ensures efficient sample retrieval in challenging lunar terrain
- Designed for reliability in extreme temperature variations

### Mobility System
- **Hybrid Legged Wheel Drive** system for extreme terrain traversal
- Capable of navigating craters, rocks, and steep slopes
- Optimized for low-gravity lunar environment

### Power System
- **Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)** as primary power source
- Supplemented with **folding origami solar panel** system
- Ensures continuous operation during lunar day and night cycles

### Daughter Rover
- Tri-leg hopping mechanism for reaching inaccessible areas
- Lightweight design for efficient mobility
- Autonomous navigation capabilities

## Competition Results

**4th Place** - International Rover Design Challenge 2025, Space Robotics Society

## Technical Achievements

- Complete mechanical design and CAD modeling
- Thermal management system for lunar environment
- Integration of multiple subsystems (power, mobility, sampling)
- Novel origami-inspired deployable solar panels
