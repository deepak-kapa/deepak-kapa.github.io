## Team Robocon, IIT Roorkee
**June 2023 – Nov 2023**

Designed and manufactured a comprehensive **Mars rover prototype** with integrated robotic manipulation capabilities.

## Rover Chassis

### Height-Adjustable Platform
- Constructed using **V-extrusions** for structural rigidity
- Integrated **front differential bar** for consistent four-wheel contact
- Stable operation on **slopes up to 40°**
- Optimized weight distribution for rough terrain

### Science Box Integration
- Onboard **soil sample analysis** (Bradford Test)
- Automated sample collection and processing
- Real-time data acquisition system

## 5-DOF Robotic Arm

### Mechanical Design
- **Carbon fiber construction** for optimal strength-to-weight ratio
- **7 kg lifting capacity**
- **Semi-differential wrist** end-effector for dexterous manipulation
- Precision joint control for accurate positioning

### Integration
- Fully integrated with rover platform
- Coordinated motion planning
- Automated package sorting mechanism (Flipkart Grid 5.0)

## Competition Results

- **13th Place** - International Rover Challenge 2024, Space Robotics Society
- **National Finalists** - Flipkart Gridshot 5.0 Robotics (24,000+ participants)

## Technical Achievements
